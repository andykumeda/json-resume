\opening{Dear [Hiring Manager],}

I am excited to apply for the position of Network Infrastructure Engineer, as advertised on your website. With over 25 years of experience in engineering and project management, I have designed and implemented large-scale enterprise server and networking infrastructures, providing both scalability and redundancy across multiple data center locations. I have also managed projects with many moving parts, which included installing and maintaining data center infrastructure.

Based on the job description, I am confident that my technical skills, communication skills, and ability to navigate a range of challenges and constraints make me a perfect fit for this role. I have experience working with hardware vendors, logistics, datacenter and network providers, and ISPs. I also have knowledge in optical transport technologies such as CWDM/DWDM, network protocols, and topologies. Additionally, I have experience writing network configuration and design documentation, as well as solving problems through automation.

I am excited about the opportunity to build a faster, safer Internet for millions of users and billions of web surfers that visit their sites each month. Please find my resume attached for your review.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
